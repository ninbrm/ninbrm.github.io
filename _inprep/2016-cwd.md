# Chronic Wasting Disease in Norway [UPDATE]

The dust has settled. Both the reindeer and moose hunt have ended in Norway. More than 4,000 heads have been collected and screened for Chronic Wasting Disease.
[Chronic Wasting Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wasting_disease) is a so called prion disease, which is an abnormal form of a normal protein commonly found in the central nervous system. 
CWD leads to neural degeneration and as such leads to a progressive decline of the animal resulting in its dead. First symptoms are difficulties in movement, making the animal more suseptible to predation.
CWD was first discovered in the '60 in Colorado USA, and has since spread in [central USA and Candada](http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/health/cwd/). 
Todate, no evidence exists from North-America that CWD can spread to species other than deer.

In March 2016, a first case of CWD was discovered in Norway during routine capturing of reindeer for the monitoring projects. 
A few months later, two moose were found with CWD (a different strain) in an area further north of the reindeer area. 
The CWD strains turn out to differ between the reindeer and moose. 
The reindeer strain of CWD seems quite similar to the one in North-America, whereas the one found in moose is a new one. 
Unfortunately, this means that for moose the experience in North-America is of little value to say anything about the risk of spreading to humans (or other animals).

These three finds of CWD triggered an immense monitoring effort with more than 4,000 heads (from moose, reindeer, and red deer) being collected during the normal fall hunt.
In addition, also deer killed in traffic or other accidents such as the recent [lightning that killed more than 300 reindeer in Hardangervidda](https://vimeo.com/180568867) were screened for CWD. 

The results of this enormous monitoring effort is that CWD seems present in the reindeer population, where the first animal was found.
One reindeer with CWD was hunted. The prevalance seems thus very low, and more importantly, it is not yet present in the other populations. 
Something about fragmentation...
Something about moose...
