# Weapons of Math Destruction (WMD)

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/

When greedy profit comes into play, solutions turn into part of the problem. 
Algorithms can be as racist or otherwise biased as people are.
However, the effects of this are not the same. Algorithms -- as everything in the digital age -- can be applied on massive scales, creating much stronger effects than a single person's bias ever can.
However, algorithms have the potential to be much more transparent than a person's decision making.
I think the key to the solution is transparancy. No algorithms that are used for policy making should be allowed as a black-box. 
Algorithms used in decision making should be transparent and open for public review.
