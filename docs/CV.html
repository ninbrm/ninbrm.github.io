<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
  In my research I aim to develop theory to support applied problems. As Kurt Lewin (social psychologist) famously said: "There is nothing as practical as a good theory."

<p>
  My past research has primarily focused on the study of <span style="text-decoration: underline">animal space use</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">movements</span> in relation to environmental heterogeneity. For this work I have combined formal theoretical developments with the analysis of large spatial data sets.

<div id="connectivity">
<p>
  In my current work is an increasing emphasis on the explicit linkage of spatial ecological processes with human activities and the mitigation thereof to support ongoing ecosystem functioning. As part of the <a href="http://www.nina.no/english/Research/Projects/Renewable-Reindeer" target="_blank">"Renewable Reindeer"-project</a>, we are evaluating the effects of human infrastructures on habitat loss and fragmentation through graph-based <span style="text-decoration: underline">connectivity</span> measures.

  I pursue further integration of ecological and societal dynamics in a Socio-Ecological Systems framework using approaches from Ecosystem Services and Environmental Psychology.
