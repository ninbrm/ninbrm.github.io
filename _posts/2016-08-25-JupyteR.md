title: A great programing interface (for R): Jupyter notebooks
---

I recently started using jupyter notebooks for a project in which we are developing Python code for the computation of habitat connectivity measures (more on this project in the future). 
in short, jupyter Notebooks are documents that combine text with live code, which are easy to share among collaborators.

Instalation of jupyter is relatively straightforward and [well documented](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
After having used it for python code, I recently discovered that it is also really powerful for use with R (i.e. the R in jupyteR). 
I found [this blog](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/09/using-r-with-jupyter-notebooks.html) that convinced me to give it a go.

I hope to publish "soon" some results from our projects using the html export option from jupyter.
