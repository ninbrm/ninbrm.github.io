# Chronic Wasting Disease, also in Norway

For those of you who read Norwegian see [here](https://www.nrk.no/viten/xl/marerittsykdommen-1.13122187) for synopsis of the brief, yet dramatic, history of [CWD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wasting_disease) in Norway.
In short, this spring (i.e. of 2016) one reindeer was discovered with CWD during capture for the reindeer monitoring project in Nordfjella. A few weeks later, two moose were found with CWD in another area further North. 

This triggered a large surveying effort of deer in Norway together with the hunters this fall, which is underway. In addition, the 318 reindeer killed by [lightening](http://www.sciencealert.com/a-lightning-strike-just-killed-300-reindeer-in-norway) in Hardangervidda were screened for CWD. The first results are both positive and negative. It seems that CWD does not occur with high incidence, unfortunately one reindeer shot in the [Nordfjella](http://www.vetinst.no/nyheter/nytt-tilfelle-cwd-pa-rein) area was found to have CWD. 

Thus, to date (September 12th) four animals (2 reindeer & 2 moose) have been found with CWD in Norway.
